## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This book teaches you to build **intelligent physical AI systems** that can:

- 🤖 Navigate autonomously in complex environments
- 👁️ Perceive and understand their surroundings using vision
- 🤝 Manipulate objects and interact safely with humans
- 🚶 Walk on two legs (bipedal locomotion)
- 💬 Understand and respond to natural language commands
- 🧠 Make decisions using vision-language-action (VLA) models
