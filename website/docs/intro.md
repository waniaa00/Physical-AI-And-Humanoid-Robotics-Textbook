## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need a physical robot?**
A: No! All labs run in simulation. Physical hardware is optional for Week 16.

**Q: Can I use Windows/Mac?**
A: Yes, via Docker. Native Ubuntu 22.04 recommended for best performance.

**Q: How much does this cost?**
A: Book is free. Optional costs: Cloud GPU ($20-50 for Isaac Sim), LLM APIs ($10-30 for Chapter 14).

**Q: Is this suitable for beginners?**
A: If you know Python basics (functions, classes), yes! We teach robotics from scratch.
